## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{The following data set has been provided through the government of Canada Open Government License. The set includes the cumulative number and percent of people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine by vaccine producer, the number of doses, the Provence or jurisdiction, and report week. The data starts from December 19, 2020 (when the first of the vaccine roll out began) till September 9, 2021. The purpose of the dataset is for transparent reporting of the government regarding vaccination numbers in the interests of public health and safety. As such each provincial government through ministry designated vaccination centers collected weekly counts of all lot numbers administered to the public. These numbers have been compiled by the federal health ministry over the entire vaccination effort to date. The data is limited in that it does not provide specificity within provinces, thus we will try to evaluate the political and social trends that impacted the rise in vaccinated amongst provinces.}
