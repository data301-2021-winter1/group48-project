## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{The following data set has been provided through the government of Canada Open Government License. The set includes the cumulative number and percent of people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine by vaccine producer, the number of doses, the Provence or jurisdiction, and report week. The data starts from December 19, 2020 (when the first of the vaccine roll out began) till September 9, 2021. The purpose of the dataset is for transparent reporting of the government regarding vaccination numbers in the interests of public health and safety. As such each provincial government through ministry designated vaccination centers collected weekly counts of all lot numbers administered to the public. These numbers have been compiled by the federal health ministry over the entire vaccination effort to date. The data is limited in that it does not provide specificity within provinces, thus we will try to evaluate the political and social trends that impacted the rise in vaccinated amongst provinces.}
## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
{The reason why we want to work with this dataset is due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects it has had on society for over a year, transforming our way of living considerably, but with the vaccines now being distributed around the world, we're coming closer and closer each time to once again being able to live normally like before, so a dataset that contains cumulatively how many people are being vaccinated is of great interest to us since it's the most objective way of observing at the advances that are being made in Canada that are slowly but surely allowing us who live here to return to our old lives. Through the evaluation we hope to uncover correlations between political and social events that impact the rise in vaccinated individuals. Additionally, with such a large set of data we hope to be able to visualize the conversion of first dose patients to that of fully vaccinated to shed light on how complications from the first dose slowed or stopped patients from going for their second dose. We are interested in this topic as COVID-19 has touched the lives of millions and this data may shed some light as to why this pandemic has yet to end. We would like to know if the question of efficacy and safety surrounding the vaccine is slowing the build of a heard immunity. As the data set contains many variables including spanning almost a year in time, it also contains the number of partially and fully vaccinated amongst provinces, and is segregated by vaccine manufacturer, making it perfect to use when building a dynamic dashboard.}

## Team Members

- Joe Gaspari: Third year Computer Science student with a degree in Biochemistry. My interests in public health, in relation to this vaccine stems from my knowledge surrounding virology and epidemiology. This data interests me as this vaccine is being callously viewed by the public as being unsafe, untested or even unproven. The spread of miss information and political factors all impact the public view, leading some populations to show slow inclines of immunization.

- Duvidu Arsakulasuriya: Fourth year Management student who is aspiring to be a Financial Accountant.
- Ivan Matos: Thid year international student at UBCO, currently pursuing a Computer Science major and a Visual Arts minor.
